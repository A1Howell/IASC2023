            <h2>What is a Constellation?</h2>
            <p>Constellations are imaginative patterns of stars that cultures throughout history have identified and named based on their unique mythologies and traditions. Ther are grouping of stars that represents one of the 88 divisions of the celestial sphere as defined by the International Astronomical Union. Many constellations are derived from old traditional asterisms, which are star patterns within a constellation (Go Astronomy, n.d.). These visual groupings, though often appearing close together, may consist of stars at varying distances. While serving as navigational aids for ancient travelers, constellations also hold cultural significance, with different civilizations attributing their own stories and characters to these celestial arrangements. Today, modern astronomy recognizes 88 official constellations covering the entire night sky, providing a standardized framework for studying and navigating the cosmos. Despite their not being physical entities, constellations continue to captivate our imagination, serving as timeless connectors between the scientific exploration of the stars and the rich tapestry of human storytelling. The 88 constellations cover the entire celestial sphere, from the north to the south pole. They range from the famous and easily spotted, such as Orion, Scorpius, and Ursa Major, to the faint and obscure. Each constellation has unique features that make it worth exploring (Go Astronomy, n.d.). We become part of a millennia-old tradition of astronomers, navigators, and storytellers, and gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of our place in the cosmos (Go Astronomy, n.d.). So, let the stars guide us through the boundless mysteries of the night sky, where science and folklore converge in a timeless dance of discovery and wonder.</p>

            <h2>What’s in a Name?</h2>
            <p>The 88 constellations include 12 zodiac constellations, which lie along the Sun's apparent path in the sky - the ecliptic. These are often the most familiar to people, and include constellations like Leo, Virgo, Scorpio, and Pisces. However, the night sky holds many more treasures in constellations less familiar to the casual observer (Go Astronomy, n.d.). The meanings behind constellations are often tied to cultural stories, religious beliefs, and practical purposes like navigation and timekeeping. Different civilizations have assigned their own stories and significance to the same group of stars, resulting in a rich tapestry of myths and legends across human history. Each constellation has it’s given name and a second name typically originating from Greek mythology. Such as Orion, in Greek mythology, Orion was a great hunter placed among the stars by Zeus. The constellation Orion is easily recognizable with its three bright "belt" stars. Expand your horizons and discover some constellations for yourself using our interactive image.</p>
