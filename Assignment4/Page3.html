             <h2>The Milky Way...Our Galaxy</h2>

             <div id="part1">
                 <p>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, characterized by a central bar-shaped structure surrounded by spiral arms. Earth's location in the Orion Arm provides a unique vantage point to observe the vast cosmic expanse of our galaxy. While the Milky Way is just one of billions of galaxies in the observable universe, our specific placement within it shapes our view of the night sky and the celestial wonders that unfold around us.</p>
             </div>

             <div id="part2">
                <p>The Milky Way is around 13.6 billion years old with large pivoting arms stretching out across the cosmos (Dobrijevic and Tereza, 2023). As inhabitants of Earth, we reside in the Orion Arm, a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Positioned approximately 27,000 light-years from the galactic center, our solar system orbits around this central region. If the center of the Milky Way were a city, we would be living in suburbia, about 25,000 to 30,000 light-years from the city center (Dobrijevic and Tereza, 2023). The Milky Way, our celestial home, is named for its luminous, milky-white appearance stretching across the night sky. According to Greek mythology, this cosmic band was created when the goddess Hera sprayed milk across the heavens. Across the globe, the Milky Way is known by different names. For instance, in China, it is called the "Silver River," and in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, it's known as the "Backbone of Night" (Dobrijevic and Tereza, 2023). Its widespread visibility prompts various interpretations, contributing to the global diversity of celestial beliefs.</p>

            <div id="part3">
                <p>Within our galaxy a black hole called Sagittarius A* was discovered in 2008, with a mass that is 4.3 million times that of the sun (Dobrijevic and Tereza, 2023). A huge disk of gas around Sagittarius A* billows out as far as 5 to 30 light-years from the supermassive black hole. Although fascinating, the galaxy is still full of new components to that need further research. The Milky Way resides within the Local Group of galaxies, made up of over 30 galaxies. It turns out that it's pretty good to know who your neighbors are, as they may be closer than you think. The Milky Way is currently hurtling towards Andromeda at 250,000mph (400,000 km/h). Though there is no need to worry just yet, this crash of cosmic proportions is not due for another 4 billion years (Dobrijevic and Tereza, 2023).</p>
