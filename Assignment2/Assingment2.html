								<p>The final thing to remember as you become a trainer are the different types of Pokémon. In total there are 18 types each with their own strengths and weaknesses. As you build your team make sure you have a good variety of Pokémon types that can deal super effective attacks, but that can also defend well against different types. It may seem difficult to remember everything now, but it will become easier with time and practice. Do your best!</p>
